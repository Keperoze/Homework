# Data Analyst Homework Repository
## This homework submission consists of two files:
## 1. **Data Analyst Homework.ipynb** - This is the main working file with all the comments and code that was used to conduct the initial data cleaning and analysis. Each step is described in Markup cells and overall conclusions of the whole process can be found at the very end of this file (section 5).
## 2. **Homework Dashboard.pbix** - this is the Power BI file used for Data visualization. It contains the following features:
### 2.1. The initial interactive Dashboard - here, two active filters (source and service) can be applied to all visualizations.
### 2.2. Custom URL Tooltip page - if mouse is hovered over URL table, it will display the newest URL information.
### 2.3. TLD Drillthrough page - showing specific information only about the selected TLD.
### Since github won't display a preview of this file, I am also attaching **Dashboard Prieview.png** to show the end result in an image.
## **Urls.csv** is the generated up-to-date URL information file, containing only the most relevant data of each URL.
## All remaining files are only here to properly load the Power BI Dashboards.
